# WeeklyCodingStats

This is a weekly coding stats ascii bar chart generator which uses the WAKATIME API to keep track of your coding stats.
It is inspired from Atul Cyriac Ajay'c [wakatime-metrics](https://github.com/athul/wakatime-metrics) which is originally written in python.
I just implemented it from scratch so that I can learn more about API's and Authorization in http requests and stuff like that.

The Program uses GitHub Gists API to update a Gist.
